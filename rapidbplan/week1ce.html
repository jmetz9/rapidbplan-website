<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Management</strong> is most likely you and maybe another owner. In this section you want to present highlights<br />of your career as it relates to the business you are starting. Leave details for a full resume you attach to the<br />back of the plan as an appendix item. Here, just give readers confidence that you know the industry and market.<br /><br /><strong>Workers</strong>. If you do not need help running your business, skip this paragraph. But if you will need help producing or delivering<br />services or products to customers, read these items carefully! The biggest mistake is to pretend a worker is an<br />independent contractor only to find they do not pass the tests below by the IRS or Worker Comp Insurance. That can<br />put you out of business and facing thousands of dollars of penalties and back taxes!<br /><br />Read here to decide if workers need to be paid as employees or contractors. The SBA has a simple overview of this<br />topic along with links to additional articles such as writing your employee manual. Check it out here - <a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/hire-contractor-or-employee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA Employers</a><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Defined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS Rules</a>&nbsp; 20 Rule Test<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/wc/employers/independent_contractors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WI DWD</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 Rule Test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/publications/wc/WKC_13486_P.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF Version</a><br />If you decide workers will be employees, try this <a href="http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/worker_classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DWD site</a> to understand your obligations for paying unemployment<br />and worker compensation insurance. <br /><br />Another small business handy guide is published by the Federal Dept. of Labor - <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/NewBus3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labor Standards for Small Business</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Last but not least for employees - wondering how much to pay them? That is not purely scientific and attracting the right workers depends on many factors. But to see what typical wages are for different jobs, visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics at <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/#wages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.bls.gov/data/#wages</a>&nbsp;to lookup wage rates.<br /><br /><strong>Advisors</strong>. The first key step is to start <strong>NOW</strong> at building a team of advisers you can work with to build a successful business.<br />These are individuals or firms that will help you prepare tax returns, decide what insurance it right for you and<br />other business related tasks. Having the right advisers can make or break your business! So start searching for<br />these resources sooner than later. One way to explore advisors is to use the <a href="files/weeke/2%20TPL%20SBC%20Summer%202014%20Flyer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCTC's Take a Professional List</a>. <br />Another way is to ask other business owners who they use and how their experience has been.<br /><em>&nbsp; (<strong>Tip:</strong> Bankers want your business <strong>AND</strong> 'work' for free!)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br /></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Funding Requirements</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The first step is to identify your suppliers and contractors you can use to get your business ready.<br /><br />A reality check for new business owners is this: If you do not know off the top of your head names of companies to buy equipment from or help you locate office space, then this is a major priority to get started on right away!<br /><br />The more specific you get on what you will buy and from whom during the planning stage will take weeks if not <strong>MONTHS</strong> off of your start-up time.<br /><br />So start calling and emailing tomorrow to find out what companies you feel comfortable using - and ask for references and check those out!</span></p>
